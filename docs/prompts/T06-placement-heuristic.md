# T06 — Placement heuristic (single trip)

Track A · Depends: T03, T05 · Branch: `feat/T06-placement-heuristic` · **Start Claude in plan mode for this one.**

## Context

Read `CLAUDE.md` §Domain conventions, `idea.md` §Optimization Strategy, §Placement Scoring, §Door-aware loading. This is the core algorithm: given cargo for ONE trip, produce placements + a list of items that didn't fit. Deterministic greedy best-fit — no global solver, no randomness.

## Contract

```ts
// src/features/optimizer/placeTrip.ts
export type TripPlanInput = {
  items: CargoItem[]; shops: Shop[]; vehicle: VehicleDefinition; config: OptimizerConfig;
  // Added by T07: per-item hook called once after each sequence item is processed
  // ({ index, total }); returning truthy aborts the tail (returned unplaced with
  // detail 'time-limit'). Undefined ⇒ original behaviour.
  onItemPlaced?: (progress: { index: number; total: number }) => boolean | void;
};
export type TripPlanOutput = {
  placements: Array<Omit<CargoPlacement, 'tripId'>>;   // tripId assigned by T07
  unplaced: Array<{ cargoId: string; shopId: string; reason: UnplacedReason; detail?: string }>;
};
export function planSingleTrip(input: TripPlanInput): TripPlanOutput;
```

## Algorithm (decisions already made — implement as specified)

**1. Door assignment (per shop).** `shop.preferredDoor` if the vehicle has that door, else `rear`. All the shop's items get this `assignedDoor` — except items that don't pass `fitsThroughDoor` (T05, either rotation) for the side door: those individually fall back to `rear` (e.g. a beverage pallet can't pass the cargo-van's 110×150 side door; the shop's crates still can). Items fitting through NO door never reach this module — T07 pre-filters them.

**2. Processing order.** Iterate shops in **reverse delivery order** (last stop first → it ends up deepest for rear-door unloading). Within a shop, sort items: `floorOnly` first → weight desc → volume desc → id asc. This yields the global insertion sequence; `loadingOrder` = 1-based index of successful placement.

**3. Candidate points.** Maintain a set starting with `(0,0,0)`, `(vehicleWidth − itemWidth, 0, depth − itemDepth)`-style wall-corner seeds is unnecessary — use classic extreme points: after placing box b at min corner (x,y,z) with size (w,h,d), add candidates `(x+w, y, z)`, `(x, y, z+d)`, `(x, y+h, z)`. For each item, also try each candidate with the item's max-z face flush against the cabin wall and each side wall when the candidate allows (clamp candidate so box fits; skip if clamping moves it onto another box — validation rejects those anyway). Dedupe points; drop points strictly inside placed boxes; cap total at `config.candidatePointCap`, evicting **highest-score-last** (keep points with lowest y, then highest z) — deterministic eviction order, document it.

**4. Orientations.** rotationY 0 and 90 (skip 90 when w === d).

**5. Validate** every (candidate × orientation) with `validateCandidate` (T05). Invalid → discard.

**6. Score** each valid placement 0–1 per component, combined with `config.weights` (normalize by weight sum):
- `deliveryOrderCompatibility`: **front-pack rule** (redesigned post-T13 for vehicle stability — see T13 worklog; originally a proportional `idealZ` band model). Rear-door items pack contiguously against the cabin wall, order-preserving: score = `faceZ / boundary` where `boundary` = min z of any already-placed LATER stop's box (else `depth`), and 0 when `faceZ > boundary` (intruding beside a later band would block its unloading). Candidate generation gained a face-flush-behind variant (`p.z − size.depth`, anchored on each placed box's min corner) so bands butt up with no gap. For side-door items: band overlap (1 if the item's z-interval overlaps its door's z-interval, else `1 − gap/depth`) blended 50/50 with **far-side-first** (far x-face distance from the door wall, normalized) — the side-door mirror of the front-pack rule, so early side-door boxes don't wall off the opening (post-T21).
- `doorAccessibility`: 1 − normalized distance from item center to its assigned door's opening center (straight-line, normalized by vehicle diagonal).
- `compactness`: fraction of the 3 min-faces (x=…, y=…, z-max toward cabin) touching a wall or another box (0, ⅓, ⅔, 1).
- `floorPreference`: `1 − min.y / vehicleHeight`.
- `weightBalance`: mean of two sub-terms (compute both incrementally; each 1 when total weight is 0). *Lateral:* 1 − |projected left/right weight delta| / totalWeightSoFar. *Longitudinal* (added post-T13 for vehicle stability, see T13 worklog): 1 − penalty for the load's prospective z-CoG deviating from mid-bay, where rear-ward deviation (toward the rear door/overhang — unloads the steering axle) is penalized 2× as hard as cabin-ward. Default weights were retuned with it: `weightBalance` 10→25, `doorAccessibility` 20→12 (empirical: rear-heavy trips 54%→30%, unloading moves −18%, trip count unchanged).
- `supportQuality`: the support ratio from T05 (1 for floor).

**7. Select** the best-scoring candidate **with a physically clear loading route** (post-T21: candidates are ranked — score desc, lower y → higher z → lower x → rotation — and walked until `planLoadingRoute` (features/optimizer/reachability.ts) verifies a corridor from the assigned door past the already-placed cargo; capped at 200 checks, then the item defers with reason `accessibility-constraint`). This makes the insertion sequence — which is stamped as `loadingOrder` — physically executable: no item ever has to pass through earlier cargo. Side-door items additionally score far-side-first (see rule 6) so they don't wall off their own opening. Place, update candidates, continue.

**8. Unplaced reasons** (per item, checked in this order): doesn't fit vehicle in any orientation → `exceeds-vehicle-dimensions` (detail: which dims); item weight alone > payload → `exceeds-payload`; remaining payload insufficient → `exceeds-payload` (detail "payload remaining"); floor-only/stacking constraints were the only failures seen → `stacking-constraint`; otherwise → `no-valid-placement`. (`accessibility-constraint` and `trip-limit-reached` are assigned by T07 — export a helper if useful.)

**9. Determinism.** No RNG at all in this module. Every iteration order is sorted with explicit tiebreakers. Candidate set kept in sorted order, not insertion order.

## Blocking metric helper (used by T08/T15 — implement here, it needs placement internals)

```ts
// src/features/optimizer/accessibility.ts
export function findBlockers(target: PlacedBox, targetDoor: VehicleDoor, others: PlacedBox[]): string[];
```
Rear door: blocker = other box with `z < target.z` whose X **and** Y intervals overlap target's (sliding the target straight out along −Z). Left door (x=0 wall): blocker = box with `x < target.x`, Z and Y intervals overlapping. Right door mirrored. Pure geometry — "delivered later" filtering is the caller's job.

## Performance target

100 items ≤ ~3s in a worker on a mid laptop. Guard: candidate cap + early bounds rejection. Add a perf smoke test (not CI-gating): 100-item synthetic input completes < 5s.

## Tests

- Everything-fits case: N small boxes all placed, zero unplaced, `validateLoad` clean.
- Rear-door ordering: 2 shops → the later-delivery shop's cargo has strictly greater mean z.
- Side door: shop preferring `left` gets items whose z-intervals overlap the door interval (build a roomy case).
- Floor-only beverage pallet never leaves floor; fragile box never has anything above it (construct temptation cases).
- Determinism: same input twice ⇒ deep-equal output.
- Overweight single item → `exceeds-payload`; oversized item → `exceeds-vehicle-dimensions`.

## Out of scope

Multi-trip looping (T07), metrics (T08), improvement pass (cut-ladder item — do not build).

## Wrap up

TASKS.md, worklog (note any spec deviations + chosen constants), commits `T06:`.
